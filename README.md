## About

New Russia Token (NRT) is a donation-linked token created to support civil society initiatives, media, and human rights organizationsâ€”especially those blocked or persecuted by Russian authorities.

## Purpose

- Encourage donations to independent organizations
- Provide symbolic recognition via token issuance
- Lay the foundation for future DAO governance
